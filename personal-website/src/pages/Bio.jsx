        I am Destiny Mburugu Gakenga, a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer specializing in Python (Flask) and React. My journey in tech is driven by a passion for using technology to solve real-world challenges in education, governance, and everyday life.

I’ve built impactful projects such as a Student Course Enrollment System, the Ratatoui Recipe App, and a Freelancer Job Tracker, each reflecting my commitment to creating tools that empower people and improve access to opportunities. What makes me unique is my ability to blend technical problem-solving with a strong focus on social impact, designing solutions that are not only functional but also meaningful.

Currently, I am sharpening my skills through the ALX Software Engineering Program, where I continue to grow as a developer and as a changemaker. For me, software development is more than just code—it’s a way to live out my passion for innovation, inclusivity, and building systems that make life better for others.
